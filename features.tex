\section{Functionality in DM releases}
\label{sect:features}

This is currently not an exhaustive feature list, but rather gives an indication at a high level of the features in each release which will be verified by the corresponding verification test campaign.
As the test plans are written this will become a list of requirements to be tested for that release and thus begin to fill out the verification control database (currently to be in Jira).

In the feature lists below, the corresponding internal milestone is given in parenthesis.

Each section here is a test milestone from \citeds{LDM-503} --- the same labels are used.
The timeline is in the DM schedule using the same labels and depicted in \figref{fig:schedule}
